With the discovery of a Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV at the LHC in 2012, the LHC and CMS physics program has evolved to include the precise characterization of the 125 GeV Higgs boson and searching for evidence of additional Higgs particles in an extended Higgs sector. This thesis presents a direct search at CMS for exotic decays of the Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV in data collected in the years 2016-2018 in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy 13 TeV, to two light neutral scalar particles that decay to two bottom quarks and two tau leptons ($h \rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$). The results are combined with another search that was performed in the $h \rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\mu\mu$ final state, giving the most stringent limits to date for theories with Two Higgs Doublet Models extended with a singlet scalar (2HDM+S), for pseudoscalar masses $m_a$ ranging from 15 GeV to 60 GeV, in a number of 2HDM+S scenarios such as type II and III with $\tan\beta = 2.0$.

As the rich physics program of CMS has set stringent limits on the exotic decay $h \rightarrow aa$, we turn our attention to direct searches for decays to light neutral scalars with potentially unequal mass, $h \rightarrow a_1 a_2$, which has not been performed at CMS to date. Preliminary studies on $h \rightarrow a_1 a_2$ signals in the Two Real Singlet Model (TRSM) are shown, and work is ongoing to develop the analysis for $h \rightarrow a_1 a_2$ in final states with bottom quarks and tau leptons.

To ensure the continued performance of the CMS detector and to enhance its data-taking capabilities in the intense pileup conditions of the Phase-2 upgrade of the High-Luminosity LHC, upgrades of the Level-1 Trigger are paramount for filtering the increased data rate of the HL-LHC. This thesis presents work on the standalone barrel calorimeter algorithm for reconstructing and identifying electron and photon candidates, using high granularity crystal-level information from the ECAL subdetector. For Phase-2, the increase in the granularity of information sent from the electromagnetic calorimeter to the Level-1 trigger, from energy sums over towers (which are $5\times 5$ in crystals) to crystal-level information, allows for the implementation of a more sophisticated clustering algorithm that can exploit the fact that genuine electrons and photons tend to leave energies concentrated a $3 \times 5$ window in crystals, and use shape and isolation information to distinguish genuine electrons and photons from noise. Electrons and photons are key to characterizing Standard Model processes and performing searches for new physics, and this represents one of the many upgrades of the CMS detector in preparation for Phase-2. With the ongoing Run-3 data collecting period, and wealth of ongoing and scheduled upgrades, there remains an abundance of directions for detector development and physics at CMS heading into Phase-2 of the LHC.
