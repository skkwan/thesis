# Thesis 

See `main.tex` and `main.pdf`.

## Nifty things

- [To-Do highlight extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) 
- `aspell`:
  ```bash
  aspell check -l en *.tex  
  ```
- If a citation is added with incorrect formatting to the `.bib`, the auto-rebuild will throw errors and refuse to fix itself. In this case, delete the `main.pdf`, and the re-build should show the citations again.
