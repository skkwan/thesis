	abstract = {The standard model has been established now for more than 20 years; it is the sine qua non in the armory of any researcher in high-energy theory. The main target of much present research is to find chinks in its armor. These have been surprisingly difficult to find; the theory’s predictions have turned out to be robust despite experiments of extraordinary precision.In 1998, an announcement from the neutrino-oscillation collaboration known as {SuperKamiokande} and buried under the Japanese alps, electrified the field by reporting compelling evidence for the first physics beyond the standard model: Data on atmospheric neutrinos showed that muon neutrinos oscillate—apparently into tau neutrinos—and hence that neutrinos have nonzero mass. These findings are at odds with the minimal standard model.},

	abstract = {We discuss theoretical and phenomenological aspects of two-Higgs-doublet extensions of the Standard Model. In general, these extensions have scalar mediated flavour changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by experiment. Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing scalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In particular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated, including the so-called type I and type {II} models as well as lepton-specific and inert models. Type {III} models are then discussed, where scalar flavour changing neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by either a specific ansatz for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of family symmetries leading to a natural suppression mechanism. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in these models. Next we turn to the role of symmetries in the scalar sector. We discuss the six symmetry-constrained scalar potentials and their extension into the fermion sector. The vacuum structure of the scalar potential is analysed, including a study of the vacuum stability conditions on the potential and the renormalization-group improvement of these conditions is also presented. The stability of the tree level minimum of the scalar potential in connection with electric charge conservation and its behaviour under {CP} is analysed. The question of {CP} violation is addressed in detail, including the cases of explicit {CP} violation and spontaneous {CP} violation. We present a detailed study of weak basis invariants which are odd under {CP}. These invariants allow for the possibility of studying the {CP} properties of any two-Higgs-doublet model in an arbitrary Higgs basis. A careful study of spontaneous {CP} violation is presented, including an analysis of the conditions which have to be satisfied in order for a vacuum to violate {CP}. We present minimal models of {CP} violation where the vacuum phase is sufficient to generate a complex {CKM} matrix, which is at present a requirement for any realistic model of spontaneous {CP} violation.},

	abstract = {We perform an extensive survey of non-standard Higgs decays that are consistent with the 125 {GeV} Higgs-like resonance. Our aim is to motivate a large set of new experimental analyses on the existing and forthcoming data from the Large Hadron Collider ({LHC}). The explicit search for exotic Higgs decays presents a largely untapped discovery opportunity for the {LHC} collaborations, as such decays may be easily missed by other searches. We emphasize that the Higgs is uniquely sensitive to the potential existence of new weakly coupled particles and provide a unified discussion of a large class of both simplified and complete models that give rise to characteristic patterns of exotic Higgs decays. We assess the status of exotic Higgs decays after {LHC} Run 1. In many cases we are able to set new nontrivial constraints by reinterpreting existing experimental analyses. We point out that improvements are possible with dedicated analyses and perform some preliminary collider studies. We prioritize the analyses according to their theoretical motivation and their experimental feasibility.

Today, the project continues to explore the social and technical problems of cooperative computing on scales ranging from the desktop to the world-wide computational Grid. In this paper, we provide the history and philosophy of the Condor project and describe how it has interacted with other projects and evolved along with the field of distributed computing. We outline the core components of the Condor system and describe how the technology of computing must correspond to social structures. Throughout, we reflect on the lessons of experience and chart the course travelled by research ideas as they grow into production systems. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The $\tau$ leptons that decay into one or three charged hadrons, zero or more short-lived neutral hadrons, and a neutrino are identified using final-state particles reconstructed in the CMS tracker and electromagnetic calorimeter.  The reconstruction efficiency of the algorithms is measured using $\tau$ leptons produced in Z-boson decays. The $\tau$-lepton misidentification rates for jets and electrons are determined.}

    journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
    abstract = {The performance and strategies used in electron reconstruction and selection at {CMS} are presented based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, collected in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV at the CERN LHC. The paper focuses on prompt isolated electrons with transverse momenta ranging from about 5 to a few 100 GeV. A detailed description is given of the algorithms used to cluster energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and to reconstruct electron trajectories in the tracker. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the calorimeter with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Benchmark selection criteria are presented, and their performances assessed using Z, Y, and J/$\Psi$ decays into $e^+ e^-$ pairs. The spectra of the observables relevant to electron reconstruction and selection as well as their global efficiencies are well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The momentum scale is calibrated with an uncertainty smaller than 0.3\%. The momentum resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays ranges from 1.7 to 4.5\%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through bremsstrahlung in the detector material.}

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.},

abstract = {An algorithm for reconstruction of the Higgs mass in $H \rightarrow \tau\tau$ decays is presented. The algorithm computes for each event a likelihood function $P(M_{\tau\tau})$ which quantifies the level of compatibility of a Higgs mass hypothesis $M_{\tau\tau}$ with measured momenta of the visible tau decay products plus the missing transverse energy reconstructed in the event. The algorithm is used in the CMS $H \rightarrow \tau\tau$ analysis, where it is found to improve the sensitivity to discover the Standard Model Higgs boson in this decay channel by about 30\%.}
