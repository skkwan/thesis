	abstract = {We discuss theoretical and phenomenological aspects of two-Higgs-doublet extensions of the Standard Model. In general, these extensions have scalar mediated flavour changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by experiment. Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing scalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In particular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated, including the so-called type I and type {II} models as well as lepton-specific and inert models. Type {III} models are then discussed, where scalar flavour changing neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by either a specific ansatz for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of family symmetries leading to a natural suppression mechanism. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in these models. Next we turn to the role of symmetries in the scalar sector. We discuss the six symmetry-constrained scalar potentials and their extension into the fermion sector. The vacuum structure of the scalar potential is analysed, including a study of the vacuum stability conditions on the potential and the renormalization-group improvement of these conditions is also presented. The stability of the tree level minimum of the scalar potential in connection with electric charge conservation and its behaviour under {CP} is analysed. The question of {CP} violation is addressed in detail, including the cases of explicit {CP} violation and spontaneous {CP} violation. We present a detailed study of weak basis invariants which are odd under {CP}. These invariants allow for the possibility of studying the {CP} properties of any two-Higgs-doublet model in an arbitrary Higgs basis. A careful study of spontaneous {CP} violation is presented, including an analysis of the conditions which have to be satisfied in order for a vacuum to violate {CP}. We present minimal models of {CP} violation where the vacuum phase is sufficient to generate a complex {CKM} matrix, which is at present a requirement for any realistic model of spontaneous {CP} violation.},

	abstract = {We perform an extensive survey of non-standard Higgs decays that are consistent with the 125 {GeV} Higgs-like resonance. Our aim is to motivate a large set of new experimental analyses on the existing and forthcoming data from the Large Hadron Collider ({LHC}). The explicit search for exotic Higgs decays presents a largely untapped discovery opportunity for the {LHC} collaborations, as such decays may be easily missed by other searches. We emphasize that the Higgs is uniquely sensitive to the potential existence of new weakly coupled particles and provide a unified discussion of a large class of both simplified and complete models that give rise to characteristic patterns of exotic Higgs decays. We assess the status of exotic Higgs decays after {LHC} Run 1. In many cases we are able to set new nontrivial constraints by reinterpreting existing experimental analyses. We point out that improvements are possible with dedicated analyses and perform some preliminary collider studies. We prioritize the analyses according to their theoretical motivation and their experimental feasibility.

    abstract = {The performance and strategies used in electron reconstruction and selection at CMS are presented based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, collected in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV at the CERN LHC. The paper focuses on prompt isolated electrons with transverse momenta ranging from about 5 to a few 100 GeV. A detailed description is given of the algorithms used to cluster energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and to reconstruct electron trajectories in the tracker. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the calorimeter with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Benchmark selection criteria are presented, and their performances assessed using Z, Y, and J/$\Psi$ decays into $e^+ e^-$ pairs. The spectra of the observables relevant to electron reconstruction and selection as well as their global efficiencies are well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The momentum scale is calibrated with an uncertainty smaller than 0.3\%. The momentum resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays ranges from 1.7 to 4.5\%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through bremsstrahlung in the detector material.}
