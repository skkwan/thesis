\section{Results from \texorpdfstring{$bb\tau\tau$}{bbtautau}}

In each of the three $\tau\tau$ channels studied ($\mu\tau_{h}$, $e\tau_{h}$, and $e\mu$), events are divided based on whether they contain exactly 1 or 2 b-tag jets, and further divided into signal and control regions (SRs and CRs) using the DNN categorization score as described in Section \ref{section:DNN-event-categorization}. The control regions demonstrate good agremeent between observed events in data, and the sum of the contributions from expected backgrounds that are modeled in simulated and embedded samples. The signal regions are defined to be sensitive to the $h \rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$ signal. The postfit final observed and expected distributions of the di-tau invariant mass $m_{\tau\tau}$ reconstructed with SVFit (described in Section \ref{section:svfit}) are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:results_mtt_postfit_mtall} for the $\mu\tau_{h}$ channel, Fig. \ref{fig:results_mtt_postfit_etall} for the $e\tau_{h}$ channel, and Fig. \ref{fig:results_mtt_postfit_emall} for the $e\mu$ channel. In all figures, the hypothesized yield for the $h\rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$ signal is shown for the pseudoscalar mass $m_a = 35$ GeV and assuming a branching fraction $B(H \rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau) = 10\%$.

The 95\% CL exclusion limits on the signal strength of the branching fraction $B(h \rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau)$ as a function of the pseudoscalar mass $m_a$ ranging from 12 GeV to 60 GeV, are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:results_limits} as percentages and normalized to the Standard Model Higgs production cross-section. The $e\mu$ channel is the only channel that can provide sensitivity to the $m_a = 12$ GeV pseudoscalar mass hypothesis, as its cut on the $\Delta R$ between the two $\tau$ legs is the smallest, which increases the signal acceptance for low mass signals.

No excess of events above the Standard Model expectations is observed. Combined expected (observed) limits between 1.4 and 5.6\% (1.7 and 7.6\%) are set for pseudoscalar masses between 12 and 60 GeV. The best sensitivity is attained at intermediate mass points, since the analysis targets a resolved signature: at low mass points, objects have a boosted signature, and at high mass points, the $m_{\tau\tau}$ distributions in signal have larger overlap with background distributions.

The branching fraction of the two pseudoscalars depends on the 2HDM+S model type, the pseudoscalar mass $m_a$, and the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values $\tan\beta$. In Type I models, the branching fraction is independent of $\tan\beta$, while in Type III and IV models, it is a function of $m_a$ and $\tan\beta$. Using the predicted values of $B(a \rightarrow ff)$, the observed limits can be used to constrain the $\tan\beta$ vs. $m_a$ phase space. 


\section{Combination procedure with \texorpdfstring{$bb\mu\mu$}{bbmumu} final state}
\label{section:ch-10-combination-procedure-with-bbmumu}
A combination of the results from $bb\tau\tau$ is performed with the analysis for the $h \rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\mu\mu$ final state \cite{CMS-AN-21-058-bbmumu}. While the $bb\mu\mu$ final state has a small branching ratio, it provides competitive results due to the excellent di-muon resolution measured by CMS. The $bb\mu\mu$ analysis uses an unbinned fit to the data using the di-muon mass $m_{\mu\mu}$ distribution.

A combination is possible because the two final states use event selections that are orthogonal to each other, as the $bb\tau\tau$ channels veto events with extra leptons. Several systematic uncertainties are treated as correlated: the integrated luminosity normalization,the b-tagging scale factor, the scale factors related to muon reconstruction, identification, and trigger efficiencies, the inefficiency in the ECAL trigger readout, and the theoretical uncertainties related to signal modeling.

The dimuon and ditau mass distributions ($m_{\mu\mu}$ and $m_{\tau\tau}$) are compared to the data in a combined maximum likelihood fit to derive upper limits on B($h\rightarrow aa$). 

\section{Results from combination}

The observed limits at 95\% CL on B($h \rightarrow aa$) for different 2HDM+S scenarios are shown for the $bb\mu\mu$ analysis in Fig. \ref{fig:results_limits_mmbb}, the $bb\tau\tau$ analysis in Fig. \ref{fig:results_limits_ttbb}, and the combined analyses in Fig. \ref{fig:results_limits_combined}. For 2HDM+S Types II, III, and IV, exclusion limits are set as a function of $\tan\beta$ and $m_{a}$, and are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:results_limits_combined_2D}.

The most stringent constraints are observed for the Type III model, which predicts combined branching fractions between 0.47 and 0.42 for $\tan\beta = 2.0$ and values of $m_{a}$ between 15 and 60 GeV, while the 95\% CL upper limits are between 0.08 and 0.03. For the Type IV model, the predicted branching fractions from theory are between 0.26 and 0.20 for $\tan\beta = 0.6$ for values of $m_{a}$ between 15 and 60 GeV, and the 95\% CL observed upper limits are between 0.12 and 0.05.

The combined analyses' results are also shown in summary plots alongside the other current CMS results for 2HDM+S limits: for type I in Fig. \ref{fig:summary_plot_type_I}, for type II with $\tan\beta = 2.0$ in Fig. \ref{fig:summary_plot_typeII_tan_beta_2p0}, and for type III with $\tan\beta = 2.0$ in Fig. \ref{fig:summary_plot_typeIII_tan_beta_2p0}. In other scenarios, e.g. type III with $\tan\beta = 5.0$, more stringent limits are set by analyses in other final states, $\mu\mu\tau\tau$ in this case.
