With the discovery of the Higgs boson with mass 125\GeV at the LHC in 2012, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experimental physics program has evolved to include the precise characterization of the Standard Model 125\GeV Higgs boson and searches for evidence of additional Higgs particles in an extended Higgs sector. Many properties of a potential extended Higgs sector remain unconstrained by current measurements, making direct searches of exotic Higgs decays a powerful probe of new physics. The decay of the 125\GeV Higgs boson into two light neutral scalar particles ($h\rightarrow aa$) is allowed in extensions of the Standard Model, such as Two Higgs Doublet Models extended with a scalar singlet (2HDM+S). We present a search at CMS for exotic decays of the 125\GeV Higgs boson to two light neutral scalars, which decay to two bottom quarks and two tau leptons ($h\rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$). This analysis is combined with a similar search in a different final state where the light scalars decay to two bottom quarks and two muons. The results from the $bb\tau\tau$ analysis and the combined analyses are interpreted in 2HDM+S scenarios. In a different extension of the Standard Model, the Two Real Singlet Model (TRSM), the 125\GeV Higgs boson can decay to two light scalars with unequal mass ($h \rightarrow a_1 a_2$). This decay has not been searched for to date at CMS. We present ongoing work on a search for $h\rightarrow a_1 a_2$, where the $a_2$ decays into two $a_1$, resulting in four bottom quarks and two tau leptons in the final state, in the $\mu\tau_{h}$ channel of the $\tau\tau$ decay. Such searches for rare processes will directly benefit from the increased datasets that will be generated by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which is scheduled to increase the LHC's number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions by a factor of five to seven. To contribute to the performance of the CMS Level-1 Trigger in selecting collisions with interesting physics, this thesis presents an upgraded algorithm for reconstructing electrons and photons in the barrel calorimeter, which will use information with higher spatial granularity to distinguish genuine electrons and photons from background.
