Open questions in particle physics may be addressed by the existence of an extended Higgs sector beyond the Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the CMS and ATLAS experiments in 2012, may answer remaining open questions in particle physics. Many properties of a potential extended Higgs sector remain unconstrained by current measurements, making direct searches of exotic Higgs decays are a powerful probe of new physics. We present a search performed at the CMS experiment for exotic decays of a Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV to two light neutral pseudoscalars which respectively decay to two bottom quarks and two tau leptons ($h\rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$), which is combined with a different analysis to the final state with two bottom quarks and two muons, with results interpreted in Two Higgs Doublet Models extended with a singlet scalar (2HDM+S). We also present preliminary work on a new search of 125 GeV Higgs boson decays to two light pseudoscalars which can have different masses ($h \rightarrow a_1 a_2$) with final states containing bottom quarks and tau leptons. This ``asymmetric'' decay scenario has not been studied to date at the CMS experiment and is predicted by Two Real Singlet Models (TRSM).
