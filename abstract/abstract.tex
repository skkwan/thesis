Open questions in particle physics may be addressed by the existence of an extended Higgs sectorm beyond the Higgs boson with mass 125\GeV discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the CMS and ATLAS experiments. Many properties of a potential extended Higgs sector remain unconstrained by current measurements, making direct searches of exotic Higgs decays a powerful probe of new physics. In extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as Two Higgs Doublet Models extended with a singlet scalar (2HDM+S), the decay of the 125\GeV Higgs boson into light neutral scalar particles is allowed. We present a search at CMS for exotic decays of a Higgs boson with mass 125\GeV to two light neutral scalars, which respectively decay to two bottom quarks and two tau leptons (denoted $h\rightarrow aa \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$). This analysis is combined with a different search where the light scalars decay to two bottom quarks and two muons. Results are interpreted in various 2HDM+S scenarios. In Two Real Singlet Models (TRSMs), the 125\GeV Higgs boson can decay to two light neutral scalars with unequal mass, denoted $h \rightarrow a_1 a_2$ where $m_{a_1} \neq m_{a_2}$. This scenario has not been searched for to date at the CMS experiment. We present ongoing work on a search for $h\rightarrow a_1 a_2$, where the $a_2$ decays into two $a_1$, resulting in four bottom quarks and two tau leptons in the final state, in the $\mu\tau_{h}$ channel of the $\tau\tau$ decay.
