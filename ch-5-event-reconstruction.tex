We review the properties of the particles most pertinent to the analyes presented in this work (taus, muons, electrons, and b-jets), their resulting signatures in the CMS detector, and dedicated reconstruction techniques used at CMS.

\section{Taus}
Tau leptons, with a mass of 1.776 GeV, are heavy enough to decay hadronically (i.e. to final states with hadrons) which it does so about 64.8\% of the time. These hadronic decays are denoted $\tau_{h}$. The remainder of the time, it decays to final states with the lighter leptons (electron or muon), termed leptonic decays. In all cases, at least one is produced, resulting in missing transverse energy in the CMS detector. The tau's largest decay branching ratios (proportional to probability of decay) are listed below \citep{workman_review_2022}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 25.5\% decay to $\pi^- \pi^0 \nu_{\tau}$
    \item 17.8\% decay to $e^- \bar{\nu}_e \nu_{\tau}$
    \item 17.4\% decay to $\mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu \nu_{\tau}$
    \item 10.8\% decay to $\pi^- \nu_{\tau}$ (excluding $K^0, \omega$)
    \item 9.3\% decay to $\pi^- 2\pi^0 \nu_{\tau}$ (excluding $K^0, \omega$)
    \item 9.0\% decay to $\pi^- \pi^- \pi^+ \nu_{\tau}$ (excluding $K^0, \omega$)
\end{itemize}

Thus in analyses containing $\tau\tau$ states, a distinction of the final states must be made for the possible combinatorics of the tau final states. For instance, a $\mu\tau_{h}$ event channel must be treated differently than a $\tau_{h}\tau_{h}$ channel.

In the CMS detector, charged pions leave tracks in the tracking detector before being absorbed in the hadronic calorimeter. Due to presence of the tracks for the charged pions, they are called ``prongs'' in hadronic tau reconstruction, giving gives rise to the names ``1 prong", ``1 prong + $\pi^0$(s)", and ``3-prong'' for the dominant hadronic tau decay modes. Neutral pions decay to two photons which lose their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Taus that decay to electrons and muons, are typically triggered on and reconstructed as electrons and muons respectively. 

At CMS, hadronically decaying tau leptons are reconstructed with the hadron-plus-strips (HPS) algorithm \citep{CMS-TAU-14-001}, which is seeded with anti-$k_T$ jets. The HPS algorithm reconstructs $\tau_{h}$ candidates on the basis of the number of tracks and the number of ECAL strips in the $\eta-\phi$ plane with energy deposits, in the 1 prong, 1 prong + $\pi^0$(s), and 3-prong decay modes. A multivariate (MVA) discriminator, including isolation and lifetime information, is used to reduce backgrounds from quark- and gluon-initiated jets that are misidentified as $\tau_{h}$ candidates. 

\section{Muons}
Muons are identified with requirements on the quality of the track reconstruction and on the number of measurements in the tracker and the muon systems \citep{CMS-MUO-10-004}. In the standard CMS reconstruction, tracks are first reconstructed independently in the inner tracker (tracker track) and in the muon system (standalone-muon track). Next, these tracks are processed in two different methods.

The first is Global Muon reconstruction (outside-in) \citep{CMS-MUO-10-004}, which fits combined hits from the tracker track and standalone-muon track, using the Kalman-filter technique. At large transverse momenta, $p_{T} \gtrsim 200$ GeV, the global-muon fit can improve the momentum resolution compared to the tracker-only fit. 

The second is Tracker Muon reconstruction (inside-out) \citep{CMS-MUO-10-004}, which starts with tracker tracks with $p_{T} > 0.5$ GeV and total momentum $p_{T} > 2.5$ GeV. These tracks are extrapolated outwards to the muon system and matched to detector segments there, taking into account the magnetic field, expected energy losses, and multiple Coulomb scattering in the detector material. Tracker Muon reconstruction is more efficient than the Global Muon reconstruction at low momenta, $p \lesssim 5$ GeV, because it only requires a single muon segment in the muon system, where as Global Muon reconstruction typically requires segments in at least two muon stations.

To further suppress fake muons from decay in flight, isolation cuts are used. A relative isolation variable is defined to quantify the energy flow of particles near the muon trajectory.
A relative isolation is defined similarly for muons and electrons:
\begin{equation}
    I^\ell \equiv \frac{\sum_{\text{charged}} p_{T} + \text{max}\left( 0, \sum_{\text{neutral}} p_{T} - \frac{1}{2}  \sum_{\text{charged, PU}} p_{T}  \right)}{p_{T}^\ell}
    \label{eqn:definition-relative-isolation}
\end{equation}
where $\sum_{\text{charged}} p_{T}$ is the scalar sum of the $p_{T}$ of the charged particles originating from the primary vertex and located in a cone of size $\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2} = 0.4 (0.3)$ centered on the direction of the muon (electron). The sum $\sum_{\text{neutral}} p_{T}$ is the equivalent for neutral particles. The sum $\sum_{\text{charged, PU}} p_{T}$ is the scalar sum of the $p_{T}$ of the charged hadrons in the cone originating from pileup vertices. The factor $1/2$ comes from simulation estimations, which find that the ratio of neutral to charged hadron production in the hadronization process of inelastic $pp$ collisions is $1/2$. Thus the subtracted term is intended to subtract contribution from pileup, from the neutral particle contribution to the isolation sum. Finally, this is divided by the lepton transverse momentum, $p_{T}^\ell$. 


\section{Electrons}
Electrons are reconstructed by associating a track reconstructed in the silicon tracking detector with a cluster of energy in the ECAL. Performance is maximized via a combination of a stand-alone approach and the complementary global particle-flow approach \citep{JINST-2015-10-P06005}. 

In the stand-alone approach, the electron energy, which is typically spread over several crystals of the ECAL, is clustered with the ``hybrid'' algorithm in the barrel and the ``multi-$5\times 5$'' in the endcaps \citep{JINST-2015-10-P06005}. The hybrid algorithm collects energy in a small window in $\eta$ and an extended window in $\phi$. It identifies a seed crystal, and adds arrays of $5 \times 1$ crystals in $\eta \times \phi$ in a range of $N = 17$ crystals in both directions of $\phi$, if their energies exceed a minimum threshold, thus forming a supercluster (SC).  In the endcap, crystals are not arranged in an $\eta \times \phi$ geometry; instead clusters are build around seed crystals in clusters of $5\times 5$ crystals that can partly overlap. Nearby clusters are grouped into a supercluster, and energy is recovered from associated deposits in the preshower. 

In the PF reconstruction \citep{JINST-2015-10-P06005}, PF clusters are reconstructed by aggregating around a seed all contiguous crystals with energies two standard deviations above the electronic noise observed at the beginning of a data-taking run. The energy of a given crystal can be shared among two or more clusters.

The electron track reconstruction is performed in two ways \citep{JINST-2015-10-P06005}: the ECAL-based seeding, which begins with the SC energy and positioning, and the tracker-based seeding (part of the PF reconstruction algorithm), which uses tracks reconstructed from the general algorithm for charged particles, extrapolated towards the ECAL and matched to an SC. Kalman filter (KF) tracks with a small number of hits or that are not well-fitted, are re-fitted with a dedicated Gaussian sum Filter (GSF).

A global identification variable \citep{JINST-2015-10-P06005} is defined using a multivariate analysis (MVA) technique that combines information on track observables (kinematics, quality of the KF track and GSF track), the electron PF cluster observables (shape and pattern), and the association between the two (geometric and kinematic observables). For electrons seeded only through the tracker-based approach, a weak selection is applied on this MVA variable. For electrons seeded through both approaches, a logical OR is taken. 

Electron isolation, i.e. the presence of energy deposits near the electron trajectory, is a separate key handle in rejecting significant background. Compared to isolated electrons, electrons from misidentified jets or genuine electrons within a jet resulting from semileptonic decays of $b$ or $c$ quarks tend to have significant energy deposits near the primary trajectory \citep{JINST-2015-10-P06005}. Offline analyses benefit from the PF technique for defining isolation, which sums the PF candidates reconstructed located within a specified isolation cone around the electron candidate, as in Eqn. \ref{eqn:definition-relative-isolation}.
